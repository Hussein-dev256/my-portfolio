On mobile, my Object ID live preview card shows the screenshot of the UI instead of showing the live UI of the web demo. The screenshot image must be only be a fall back incase the web demo is down, only and only then. But now, on desktop I see the live UI of the eb demo, but on mobile, I see the screensthot instead. Fix this mismatch. Another task, is that I need the favicon `c:\Users\HUSSEIN\Desktop\Projects\my-portfolio\site\public\favicon.svg` to be used as the icon everywhere, even on the links when eing shared on social media, on the browser most visited sites, it is the icon of the platform.
