I'm building an eCommerce site where a user can access the platform without having to create an account, browse products, adjust quantity, add to cart, enter delivery details through a contact form, choose payment method then confirm order and proceed to checkout. The vendor can add and edit products, receive orders confirmed by the client, prepare and deliver order. The system displays products to the user and so on you know what an eCommerce system does. Just that here, payment is handled outside the system, the user chooses a payment method and the system; i)if the user chooses mobile money, the system redirects the user to the phone app and they are supposed to upload a screenshot of the payment transaction message which is manually verified by the user. ii)if the user chooses Cash on Delivery, the user is allowed to confirm order and proceed. And I'm facing several challenges; Challenge 1: vendor receives the orders from clients but when the vendor clicks on the order to see the order details, we get that image i have shared. Here is the vendor console log, "". You can read the Read-me file I have attached for more information on the project that you can use. Identify the problem, its cause, why it is happening, how to fix it correctly, how to fix anything else that comes as a ripple effect of the fix and state the expected behaviour and what not to do. Identify any other problems I may have failed to identify and follow the same flow
