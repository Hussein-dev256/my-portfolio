PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY 
I am a JavaScript Software Engineer with strong experience across the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, building reliable, production-grade web systems and apps. My work covers backend service development and API design with Node.js, Express and NestJS, as well as frontend engineering with React and Next.js, where I focus on building data-driven, maintainable user interfaces. I am comfortable owning features across the full application lifecycle, from requirement gathering through design and implementation to deployment, while keeping systems clean, wellstructured, and easy to evolve. In parallel, I actively use and deepening my Python skills for backend and data-oriented applications.
